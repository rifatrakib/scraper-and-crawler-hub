# Scraper and Crawler Hub

This repository includes several examples of web scrapers and crawlers which serves the following purposes:

* __Scraping Hacker News__: This example uses [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape the [`Hacker News`](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) front page.

* __Using the Hacker News API__: This example provides an alternative by showing how you can use APIs with [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* __Quotes to Scrape__: This example uses [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and introduces the [`dataset`](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library as an easy means to store data.

* __Books to Scrape__: This example uses [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), as well as the [`dataset`](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, illustrating how you can run a scraper again without storing duplicate results.

We also introduce the [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) library to create plots in Python.
