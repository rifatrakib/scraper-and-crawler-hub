## GitHub Star Scraper

We're going to scrape [https://github.com](https://github.com), using [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Our goal is to get, for a given GitHub `username`, like, for example, [https://github.com/google](https://github.com/google), a list of repositories with their GitHub-assigned programming language as well as the number of stars a repository has.
