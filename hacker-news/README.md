## Hacker News (Scraper)

In this sub-project, we are going to scrape the [`Hacker News`](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) front page, using [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Take some time to explore the page if you havenâ€™t heard about it already. Hacker News is a popular aggregator of news articles that `"hackers"` (computer scientists, entrepreneurs, data scientists) find interesting. We'll store the scraped information in a simple Python list of dictionary objects for this sub-project.
