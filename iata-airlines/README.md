## IATA scraper

We're going to scrape airline information using the search form available at [http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx](http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx). This is an interesting case to illustrate the `"nastiness"` of some websites, even though the form we want to use looks incredibly simple (there's only one drop-down and one text field visible on the page). As the URL already shows, the web server driving this page is built on `ASP.NET (".aspx")`, which has very peculiar opinions about how it handles form data. It is a good idea to try submitting this form using your browser and taking a look at what happens using its developer tools - it seems that a lot of form data get included in the POST request â€” much more than our two fields.

Certainly, it does not look feasible to manually include all these fields in our Python script. The `"__VIEWSTATE"` field, for instance, holds session information that changes for every request. Even some names of fields seem to include parts of which we can't really be sure that they wouldn't change in the future, causing our script to break. In addition, it seems that we also need to keep track of cookies as well. Finally, take a look at the response content that comes back from the POST request. This looks like a partial response (which will be parsed and shown by JavaScript) instead of a full HTML page.

To handle these issues, we're going to try to make our code as robust as possible. First, we'll start by performing a GET request to the search page, using sessions mechanism from [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Next, we'll use [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get out all the form elements with their names and values.
